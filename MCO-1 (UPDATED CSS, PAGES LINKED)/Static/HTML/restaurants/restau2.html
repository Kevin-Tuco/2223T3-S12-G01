				<div class="revMain">The Giving Table fell short of expectations. While the philanthropic aspect is commendable, the execution in terms of flavors and culinary expertise was lacking. The dishes lacked creativity and failed to excite my taste buds. It's disappointing when a well-intentioned concept doesn't translate into an exceptional dining experience.</div>
